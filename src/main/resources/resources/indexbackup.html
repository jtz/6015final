    <h2>About Me</h2>

        well-prepared for the "<strong>Fintech Revolution</strong>". <br>
        <em>CS601 Web Application Development</em> is my 5th course and I hope to expand my knowledge on front-end

<section id="experience">
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>After graduation, I worked as an Institutional Sales Manager in a leading investment bank in China.
        My work involved developing and maintaining business relationships with institutional investors by analyzing
        and solving their investment problems. I spent each day dealing with a plenty of information, absorbing fresh
        insights from security analysts with their research reports, and suggesting investment ideas to sharp-sighted
        clients. This experience made me realized that financial services are highly information-driven and rely on
        appropriate information technology to facilitate a multitude of actions. </p>
    <p>I moved to the Bay Area in 2016. Life here is wonderful！Inspired by surrounding environment, I found I was
        interested in programming and decided to combine my financial background with software development to explore
        more possibilities of my career development. Therefore, I pursue my second Master's degree in this program. </p>
