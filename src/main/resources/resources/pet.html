      <h2>About Ziye</h2>
      <p>I used to have a gray medium-hair cat named Ziye. She was three-month old and looked helpless when I first saw
         her in shelter, so I adopted her and treated her as my family. She was a troublemaker rather than a docile pet
         when she was young. She liked jumping from dinning table to sofa, or from cat tree to TV stand. When she growed
         up, she became warm with me, and she often dragged her favorate toys to me. But she feared strangers so much
         that she would hide herself under bed when someone visited my home.</p>
