                <li>Name: Ziye</li>
                <li>Color: Gray Tuxedo</li>

            </ul>
            <p>I used to have a gray medium-hair cat named Ziye. She was three-month old and looked helpless when I
                first saw her in shelter, so I adopted her and treated her as my family. She was a troublemaker rather
                than a docile pet when she was young. She liked jumping from dinning table to sofa, or from cat tree
                to TV stand. When she grown up, she became warm with me, and she often dragged her favorite toys to
                me. But she feared strangers so much that she would hide herself under bed when someone visited my home.</p>
