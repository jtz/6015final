      <h2>About Sichuan</h2>
      <p>My hometown is Sichuan Province located in southwest China. Traditionally, Sichuan is well-known for its
         picturesque scenery and gourmet cuisine, and it's always been a popular tourist destination for both domestic
         and foreign visitors. An old Chinese saying compares Sichuan to <strong>an earthly paradise</strong> or
         <strong>the Country of Heaven</strong>. Benefit from the moderate climate and the rich natural resource,
         people here live a happy leisure life. </p>

      <h2>Local Cuisine</h2>
      <p>Sichuan is well known for its spicy cuisine and use of Sichuan peppers due to its humid climate. We Sichuanese
         are proud of our cuisine, known as one of the Four Great Traditions of Chinese cuisine. An old saying goes
         <em>"one dish, one shape, hundreds of dishes, hundreds of tastes"</em> to describe its acclaimed diversity.
         The most prominent traits of Sichuanese cuisine are described by four words: spicy, hot, fresh and fragrant.</p>
      <p>For me, the most attractive part of living Sichuan is the gourmet local cuisine. The local dishes that should
         not be missed are as follows: </p>

         as well as diverse forest ecosystems, snow-capped peaks, waterfalls and hot springs. Huanglong is also home to
         many endangered species including the giant panda and the Sichuan golden snub-nosed monkey. <strong>Click
